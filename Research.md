## Research Work

### Recognised Researcher @Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain

Worked as a Recognised Researcher in the Predictable Parallel Computing Group, Computer Science Dept., Barcelona Supercomputing Center. My research work mainly focussed on orchestrating (deployment and monitoring) the workflow on the computing continuum consisting of Edge/Fog and Cloud resources for the realtime/time-senstive applications. 

### Visiting Researcher/Postdoctoral Researcher @UNICAMP, Brazil
As a Visiting Researcher/Postdoctoral Researcher at LRC, UNICAMP, worked on developing the orchestration controller for dynamic deployment of the user requests on multi-level computing architecture. The Video Streaming/VoD requests are handled using the multi-level Edge/Fog-Cloud Computing Architecture to stream videos and thus ensure the viewers' QoE and QoS. 

### Doctoral Researcher @NITK, Surathkal, Karnataka
Doctoral research focused on developing the fog framework on the resources constrained devices using docker containers to host and process the IoT/IIoT service requests. Developed a container-based two-level fog framework and then proposed various multi-objective optimization-based service placement strategies using evolutionary algorithms to place the IoT/IIoT service requests in the fog framework. The fog server-based prototype is developed to analyze and classify the machine's operating sounds as normal and abnormal and thus monitor the malfunctioning machines based on their operating sounds in the Smart Industry/Industry 4.0 environment. Further, the fog framework is used to analyze the videos at the device level to identify and classify the vehicles, normal and abnormal activities in Smart Surveillance Environments. 

## Research Interests
- Orchestrating the service deployment and monitoring the resource in the computing continumm consisting of the Edge-Fog-Cloud Computing Environment. 
- Deploying the Machine Learning models on edge devices referred to as Edge AI to extract the insights at the network level to make the early decision, reduce the data size and avoid the failures/handle critical issues in the smart environments. 
- The resource allocation and service management using network devices to support the orchestration of access and core network functions for various use cases in vertical industries such as Automated/Connected Vehicle, Industry 4.0, Smart Health-care, and Video streaming/VoD services. 
- Network slicing for 5G network supports the orchestration of both access and core network functions for various use cases in vertical industries such as Automotive, Healthcare, and Media, thus providing multiple services and corresponding QoE/QoS requirements. 
- Focussing on GENAI and Cyber Security
